jira2bugzilla.rb

Download JIRA issues and attachments and transform them into Bugzilla-compatible XML files.

A couple notes:

* This script is not going to "just work". It's a template.
* No notion of QA contact. Leave it off so that a per-project/component default is used.
* Ensure all products and components are available in the Bugzilla instance. If either are missing, the import script will use the default product and component.
* No severity in JIRA, so assign "Sev2".
